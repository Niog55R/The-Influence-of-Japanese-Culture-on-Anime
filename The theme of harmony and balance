The concept of harmony (or wa) is an important part of Japanese philosophy. In anime, characters often face conflicts that require restoring balanceâ€”not only in the outside world, but also within themselves. Example: Avatar: The Last Airbender (although not a Japanese anime, it is based on Japanese philosophy and culture) shows the struggle to restore balance to the elements.
