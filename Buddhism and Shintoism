Japanese mythology and religious teachings such as Buddhism and Shintoism are closely intertwined with anime plots. It is common to see characters interacting with spiritual beings, gods, or mythological creatures such as kami (nature spirits). Examples: anime such as Princess Mononoke or Spiritual Away clearly have a Shinto aspect, with forest and nature spirits playing an important role.
