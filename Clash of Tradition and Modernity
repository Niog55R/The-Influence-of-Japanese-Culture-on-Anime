Many anime explore the theme of traditional Japanese values ​​clashing with the modern world. Characters may be divided between old customs and new trends, which often serves as the basis for conflicts in the plot. Example: "K-On!" is an anime about modern school life, in which traditional values ​​and customs often appear in the context of popular youth culture.
