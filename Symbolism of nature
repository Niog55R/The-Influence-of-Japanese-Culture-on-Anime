Nature and its elements (trees, water, mountains) often play a key role in Japanese mythology and, accordingly, in anime. These elements often symbolize changes, life cycles, or the inner experiences of the characters. Example: in "My Neighbor Totoro", nature is presented as something magical and alive, and the character Totoro himself personifies the spirit of the forest.
