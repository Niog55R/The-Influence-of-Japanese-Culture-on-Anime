Many anime are about heroes who undergo inner transformation, often with the help of teachers or spiritual guides. This reflects the Japanese concept of self-improvement and striving for perfection, where the journey is important, not just the destination. Example: "Dragon Ball Z" - the hero Goku constantly grows, overcoming his weaknesses and learning to be a better person.
